# Steven's Action Items - In Order

## Right Now (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Run the emergency fix
cd /Users/ttig/downloads/geminopus-branch
./DO_THIS_NOW.sh
```

This automated script will:
- Apply the code fixes
- Guide you through restarting the backend
- Test that messages no longer duplicate

## After Emergency Fix (10 minutes)

```bash
# 2. Read the executive summary
cat README_STEVEN.md

# 3. See what was changed
cat WHAT_I_DID.md

# 4. Understand the problem visually
cat MESSAGE_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md
```

## Planning the Refactor (30 minutes)

```bash
# 5. Read the refactoring plan
cat UNFUCK_PLAN.md

# 6. Review your original architecture
cat IDEAL_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md

# 7. See detailed implementation examples
cat COMPLETE_FIX_GUIDE.md
```

## Testing & Verification

```bash
# Test that duplication is fixed
python3 verify_fixes.py

# Test simple message sending
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/channels/test_simple \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"channel_id": "general", "content": "No more duplicates!"}'

# Check system health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health | python3 -m json.tool
```

## The Path Forward

### Week 1: Emergency Fixes (Done today!)
- âœ… Stop message duplication
- âœ… Disable broken minion responses
- âœ… Single message path only

### Week 2: ADK Event Bus
- Replace custom communication system
- All messages through proper events
- Single source of truth

### Week 3: Proper ADK Agents
- Rewrite MinionAgent to use predict()
- Remove custom message queuing
- Real ADK tool implementation

### Week 4: Clean Architecture
- Separate domain from infrastructure
- Event-driven state changes
- Match your original design document

## Remember

Your original `IDEAL_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` is perfect. Everything else is noise that diverged from it. The goal is to delete all the custom bullshit and implement what you originally designed.

Good luck unfucking this! You've got this. ðŸš€
