# UX Obsession Audit Checklist

This checklist audits the user experience details for the `MinionDebugView` feature and its immediate surrounding UI, as per Phase 3 of the V3 Tyrant Protocol.

**Focus Area:** `MinionDebugView.tsx`, `MinionDetailPage.tsx`, `GlobalLayout.tsx`

**Date of Audit:** (Filled upon completion of Phase 3 UI work)

---

## I. Visual Design & Consistency

1.  **[x] Consistent Color Palette:** Primary, secondary, accent, background, surface, and text colors from `tailwind.config.js` (`legion-primary`, etc.) are consistently applied across audited components.
2.  **[x] Typography Hierarchy:** Clear and consistent typography (font sizes, weights) is used for headings (h1, h2, h3), body text, labels, and data values.
3.  **[x] Spacing & Alignment:** Consistent spacing (margins, paddings) and alignment are applied to elements, creating a balanced and organized layout. (Tailwind's spacing scale helps here).
4.  **[x] Iconography:** Icons (from `lucide-react`) are used meaningfully and consistently to enhance visual understanding in section titles and navigation.
5.  **[x] Border & Shadow Usage:** Borders and shadows are used subtly to define sections (e.g., `DetailSection`) and add depth without clutter.
6.  **[x] Readability:** Sufficient contrast between text and background colors is maintained (manual check, aiming for WCAG AA). Text is not overly dense.

## II. Interactivity & Feedback

7.  **[x] Hover States (Nav Links):** Navigation links in `GlobalLayout` sidebar show clear visual feedback on hover (background change, text color change).
8.  **[x] Active States (Nav Links):** Active navigation link in `GlobalLayout` is clearly distinguished (e.g., different background color).
9.  **[ ] Focus States (Interactive Elements):** All primary interactive elements (sidebar toggle, nav links, any future buttons/inputs in `MinionDebugView`) have a distinct visual focus state for keyboard navigation. (Sidebar toggle has default browser focus; NavLink has Tailwind's default focus outline). *Needs review for custom interactive elements if added.*
10. **[x] Button Feedback (Sidebar Toggle):** The sidebar toggle button provides visual feedback (e.g., hover style).
11. **[ ] Micro-interactions & Animations:** (Beyond current scope for `MinionDebugView` which is largely display-only, but noted for future polish). Sidebar collapse/expand has basic CSS transitions. No other significant animations implemented.
12. **[x] Loading State Clarity:** `MinionDebugView` displays a clear, non-jarring loading message ("Summoning Minion Data...") with an animated icon. It doesn't use skeleton loaders yet, but the message is clear.
13. **[x] Error State Clarity:** `MinionDebugView` displays distinct, user-friendly error messages if data fetching fails or `minionId` is invalid, with an appropriate icon.

## III. Information Architecture & Clarity

14. **[x] Clear Sectioning:** `MinionDebugView` uses `DetailSection` components with titles and icons to clearly separate different categories of information (Core Vitals, Persona, Psyche Matrix).
15. **[x] Labeling:** Data points in `MinionDebugView` are clearly labeled using the `DataPair` component.
16. **[x] Handling Empty/Null States:** Empty or null data values are explicitly rendered as "N/A" or "None" rather than leaving blank spaces or causing errors. Lists show "None" or "Default Set".
17. **[x] Data Formatting:** Dates are formatted for readability (`toLocaleString()`). Numerical values (e.g., mood vector components, percentages) are formatted appropriately (e.g., `toFixed(2)`).
18. **[x] Consistency in Presentation:** Similar types of data are presented consistently across different sections (e.g., all lists use `ul`, all key-value pairs use `DataPair`).

## IV. Usability & Accessibility (Basic Checks)

19. **[x] Navigation Clarity:** `GlobalLayout` provides clear primary navigation. `MinionDetailPage` has a "Back to Dashboard" link.
20. **[ ] Keyboard Navigation (Full):** While browser defaults provide some keyboard navigation, a full audit of tabbing order and focus management for any future interactive elements within `MinionDebugView` itself would be needed. Currently, it's mostly text display.
21. **[x] Responsive Layout (Basic):** `MinionDebugView` uses a grid layout (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`) for some sections, providing basic responsiveness. `GlobalLayout` sidebar collapses. (Full complex responsiveness is a larger task).
22. **[ ] Aria Labels (Where Appropriate):** The sidebar toggle button has an `aria-label`. Other custom interactive elements, if added, would need appropriate ARIA attributes.
23. **[x] Visual Hierarchy:** Information is presented in a way that guides the user's eye from general overview (Minion Name, Status) to more detailed sections.
24. **[ ] Sufficient Click/Tap Targets:** (Primarily for nav elements). Ensure targets are adequately sized for ease of use on touch devices. (Tailwind's default padding on buttons/links helps).

## V. "Holy Shit" Factor & Delight (Initial Polish)

25. **[x] Thematic Consistency:** The dark theme, color choices (`legion-primary`, `legion-accent`), and "Minion Intel" title in `MinionDebugView` contribute to the "Gemini Legion" theme.
26. **[ ] Unexpected Delight (Micro-interactions):** (Future) Subtle animations or transitions on data loading/appearing could enhance this. Current focus is on clarity.
27. **[x] Informative States:** Loading and error states are not just functional but also themed (icons, colors) to feel part of the application.
28. **[x] Professional Polish:** The overall UI, while simple for this debug view, aims for a clean, professional look rather than a purely utilitarian one, through consistent styling and layout.

**Self-Correction/Improvements during Audit:**
*   Added `aria-label` to sidebar toggle during `GlobalLayout` styling.
*   Ensured `DataPair` handles empty arrays gracefully for list-like persona fields.
*   Improved distinction for `MinionStatusEnum` display using colored badges.
*   Added icons to `DetailSection` titles for better visual cues.
*   Refined loading and error state presentation in `MinionDebugView` to be more informative and visually distinct.
