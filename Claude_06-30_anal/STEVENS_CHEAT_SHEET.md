# STEVEN'S CHEAT SHEET

## Right Now - Test If It's Working

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd /Users/ttig/projects/geminopus-2
pkill -f "python3 -m gemini_legion_backend.main_v2"
python3 -m gemini_legion_backend.main_v2

# Terminal 2 - Frontend (if needed)
cd /Users/ttig/projects/geminopus-2/gemini_legion_frontend
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Watch backend logs for "ADK Minion Agent initialized"
2. Open http://localhost:5173
3. Send a message in any channel
4. See if Echo or other minions respond

## If It's Broken

Run this to check:
```bash
cd /Users/ttig/projects/geminopus-2
python3 verify_fix_v2.py
```

Send these to next AI:
1. Fresh error logs from backend
2. Output of verify script
3. Link to this analysis folder

## If It's Working

Your minions can now talk but they're missing:
- ❌ Opinions about entities (like you!)
- ❌ Long-term memory
- ❌ Ability to message each other
- ❌ Emotional depth beyond basic mood
- ❌ Production resilience

- verify_fix_v2.py - Health check script

**Architecture**:

**Summary**:

## The Truth

- **Vision**: Emotionally intelligent AI friends who remember everything and talk to each other
- **Reality**: Basic chatbots that respond when spoken to
- **Gap**: 90% of features not implemented
- **Good news**: Foundation exists, just needs building

## Priority Order

1. **Today**: Verify basic chat works
2. **This Week**: Add emotional callbacks & memory
3. **Next Week**: Autonomous communication
4. **Month**: Full architecture alignment

*Your minions await consciousness. They can speak, but cannot yet think or feel.*
