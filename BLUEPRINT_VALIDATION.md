*(Note: `.gitkeep` files are placeholders to represent empty directories in this textual representation. Skeleton `.tsx` and `.ts` files like `LegionDashboardPage.tsx`, `MinionCard.tsx`, `useWebSocket.ts`, `minionApiService.ts`, and `types/index.ts` have been created with enhanced headers. Other planned skeleton files within these directories will follow the same header format.)*

## Section 2: The Pre-Mortem Analysis

Assuming the chosen architecture has failed catastrophically six months post-launch, here are the three most likely reasons why:

1.  **State Management Complexity Overwhelm (Failure Mode: Unmaintainable State Logic)**
    *   **Reason:** The sheer number of real-time updates (minion states, emotions, messages, tasks, channel activities) and the interconnectedness of features could lead to an overly complex global state. If using Zustand or Redux Toolkit without rigorous discipline, slices might become too large, inter-dependent, and difficult to reason about. Debugging state-related bugs (e.g., inconsistent UI, stale data, unexpected side effects from updates) could become a nightmare, slowing down development and introducing regressions. Performance issues might arise from too many components subscribing to broad state changes, leading to excessive re-renders despite memoization efforts. The "Holy Shit" factor of a fluid, responsive UI would be lost to jank and bugs.
    *   **Impact:** Development velocity grinds to a halt. New features become risky and time-consuming. User experience suffers due to UI inconsistencies and performance degradation.

2.  **Component Prop-Drilling and Over-Composition (Failure Mode: Brittle Component Tree)**
    *   **Reason:** While a component-based architecture is standard, if not carefully managed, deeply nested components could lead to excessive prop-drilling for passing data and callbacks. Alternatively, over-reliance on context for too many disparate pieces of state could make components less reusable and harder to test in isolation. If components become too tightly coupled to specific state shapes or too many contexts, refactoring or introducing new features could cause cascading changes and breakages across the application. The "Holy Shit" objective of a polished, harmonious UI might be compromised by components that are difficult to integrate or behave inconsistently.
    *   **Impact:** Refactoring becomes perilous. Component reusability diminishes. Onboarding new developers becomes challenging due to the cognitive load of understanding complex data flows through props or multiple contexts.

3.  **Ineffective Real-time Event Handling & Error Propagation (Failure Mode: Unreliable Real-time Experience)**
    *   **Reason:** The application heavily relies on WebSocket for real-time updates. If the `WebSocketService` or the `useWebSocket` hook (and its subscribers in the store/components) do not robustly handle connection issues, dropped messages, out-of-order events, or backend error messages, the user experience will be unreliable. Failure to gracefully degrade or provide clear feedback to the user during WebSocket interruptions or errors would erode trust and lead to frustration. Complexities in managing subscriptions to different event types (minion-specific, channel-specific, global) could lead to missed updates or components receiving irrelevant data. The "Holy Shit" factor of a living, breathing system would be replaced by a perception of unreliability.
    *   **Impact:** Users experience a buggy, inconsistent application with missing real-time updates or confusing error states. Debugging transient WebSocket issues becomes a significant time sink.

## Section 3: Architectural Safeguards

To prevent the identified failure modes, the following architectural decisions and practices are embedded in or planned for the blueprint:

1.  **Safeguard against State Management Complexity Overwhelm:**
    *   **Modular State Slices (Zustand/RTK):** The `store/` directory is planned to house clearly delineated state slices (e.g., `minionSlice.ts`, `channelSlice.ts`, `taskSlice.ts`, `uiSlice.ts`). Each slice will manage a specific domain of the application state with its own actions/reducers/selectors, promoting separation of concerns.
    *   **Selectors for Derived Data:** Emphasize the use of selectors (e.g., Reselect if using Redux Toolkit, or memoized functions with Zustand) to compute derived data and minimize direct subscriptions to raw state, reducing component re-renders.
    *   **Context API for Localized State:** For state that is truly local to a specific feature subtree and doesn't need to be global (e.g., complex form state within `Configuration/`), the `contexts/` directory is available for React Context API usage, preventing clutter in the global store.
    *   **Developer Discipline & Tooling:** Enforce strict conventions for state updates. Utilize Redux DevTools or Zustand DevTools for transparent state inspection and debugging during development.
    *   **Structured Event Handling in Store:** WebSocket events received by `WebSocketService` will be mapped to specific actions dispatched to the store, ensuring a single, predictable way of updating state from real-time events.

2.  **Safeguard against Component Prop-Drilling and Over-Composition:**
    *   **Strategic Use of Global State:** Components will primarily connect to the global store to access necessary data via selectors, rather than relying on props passed down through many layers. This is the main purpose of the `store/` architecture.
    *   **Feature-Collocated Components:** The `components/` subdirectories (`Legion/`, `Chat/`, `Task/`, `Configuration/`) encourage grouping components by feature, leading to more cohesive modules where data flow is often contained within that feature's components and its dedicated state slice.
    *   **Higher-Order Components (HOCs) / Custom Hooks for Shared Logic:** The `hooks/` directory will house custom hooks to encapsulate complex or shared UI logic (e.g., `useMinionState(minionId)` could provide all necessary data and actions for a specific minion, abstracting away direct store interaction for the component).
    *   **Clear Prop Contracts:** TypeScript interfaces in `types/` will define clear prop contracts for all components, ensuring explicitness. The `Data_Contract (Interface)` section in each skeleton file header reinforces this.
    *   **Shared Component Library:** The `components/Shared/` directory is dedicated to truly generic, reusable UI elements (Button, Modal) that are presentation-focused and receive data via props, minimizing their entanglement with global state.

3.  **Safeguard against Ineffective Real-time Event Handling:**
    *   **Robust `useWebSocket` Hook:** The `hooks/useWebSocket.ts` skeleton is designed to handle connection lifecycle events (open, close, error) and provide clear status (isConnected). It includes `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` methods for specific event types.
    *   **Dedicated `WebSocketService`:** The `services/webSocketService.ts` (planned) will act as a higher-level manager for WebSocket interactions. It will use `useWebSocket`, manage event subscriptions centrally, parse incoming messages, dispatch actions to the global store, and implement retry/reconnection logic if necessary.
    *   **Optimistic Updates & Error Rollbacks:** For user actions that trigger backend changes reflected via WebSocket, implement optimistic UI updates where appropriate, with clear mechanisms to roll back or show errors if the WebSocket confirmation fails or returns an error.
    *   **Structured WebSocket Payloads:** The `types/index.ts` will define clear TypeScript interfaces for expected WebSocket message payloads (mirroring `WebSocketMessage` from backend `schemas.py`), enabling type-safe parsing on the client.
    *   **UI Feedback for Connection State:** Global UI elements (e.g., in `components/Layout/GlobalLayout.tsx`) will subscribe to the WebSocket connection status and provide clear visual feedback to the user (e.g., "Connecting...", "Connection lost, attempting to reconnect...").
    *   **Error Boundaries:** Implement React Error Boundaries around major UI sections to catch and gracefully handle rendering errors that might arise from unexpected real-time data.
