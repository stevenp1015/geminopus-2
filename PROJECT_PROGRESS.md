## Current Status Summary

**Backend (85% Complete):**
- Core intelligence layers are COMPLETE (emotional engine, memory, tools)
- API endpoints are COMPLETE
- Missing: Application service layer, persistent storage, production features

**Frontend (70% Complete):**
- All major UI components are built
- API integration layer created
- Missing: Complete store integration, WebSocket event handling, auth

**Next Priority Actions:**
1. Complete store integration with API services
2. Implement application service layer in backend
3. Add persistent storage for channels and messages
4. Wire up WebSocket events to UI updates
5. Add authentication system
