# Bidi-streaming(live) in ADK

!!! info

    This is an experimental feature. Currrently available in Python.

!!! info

    This is different from server-side streaming or token-leven streaming. This section is for bidi-streaming(live).
    
Bidi-streaming(live) in ADK adds the low-latency bidirectional voice and video interaction
capability of [Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) to
AI agents.

With bidi-streaming(live) mode, you can provide end users with the experience of natural,
human-like voice conversations, including the ability for the user to interrupt
the agent's responses with voice commands. Agents with streaming can process
text, audio, and video inputs, and they can provide text and audio output.

-   :material-console-line: **Quickstart (Streaming)**

    ---

    In this quickstart, you'll build a simple agent and use streaming in ADK to
    implement low-latency and bidirectional voice and video communication.

-   :material-console-line: **Streaming Tools**

    ---

    Streaming tools allows tools (functions) to stream intermediate results back to agents and agents can respond to those intermediate results. For example, we can use streaming tools to monitor the changes of the stock price and have the agent react to it. Another example is we can have the agent monitor the video stream, and when there is changes in video stream, the agent can report the changes.
