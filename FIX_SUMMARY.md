# What I Fixed in Your Codebase

## Changes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Message Duplication** 
**File**: `channel_service.py`
**Line**: ~446
**Change**: Commented out `await self._notify_active_minions(channel_id, message)`

This stops messages from being sent through two separate paths. Now messages only go through the communication system's message router, which handles WebSocket broadcasting via the callback.

### 2. **Re-enabled Turn-Taking**
**File**: `communication_system.py`  
**Line**: ~140-170
**Change**: Restored the turn-taking logic and removed the `can_speak = True` override

This prevents minions from spamming responses. They now have to wait their turn and respect a 2-second cooldown between messages.

### 3. **Fixed ADK Integration Fallback**
**File**: `communication_capability.py`
**Line**: ~433-450
**Change**: Modified `_direct_llm_call` to use `agent.predict()` instead of returning placeholder text

This attempts to use ADK's proper prediction method. If it fails, it returns a simple acknowledgment instead of the "ADK integration needs work" placeholder.

## How to Test

1. **Restart the backend**:
   ```bash
   # Kill the current process, then:
   cd /Users/ttig/downloads/geminopus-branch
   python3 -m gemini_legion_backend.main
   ```

2. **Run the verification script**:
   ```bash
   python3 verify_fixes.py
   ```

3. **Expected results**:
   - ✅ Test message appears only once
   - ✅ No placeholder responses
   - ✅ Minion responses are throttled by turn-taking

## What's Still Needed

### Short-term
- Monitor for any edge cases where messages might still duplicate
- Verify minion responses are using actual ADK predict() method
- Test with multiple minions to ensure turn-taking works properly

### Long-term (Proper ADK Integration)
The current architecture is fighting against ADK instead of embracing it. You need to:

1. **Use ADK's native session management** instead of custom message queues
2. **Replace the custom communication system** with ADK's event bus
3. **Implement proper ADK tools** for communication instead of the hybrid approach

## Files Created

1. `MESSAGE_DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed analysis of the issue
2. `QUICK_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step fix guide
3. `COMPLETE_FIX_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive fix with long-term solutions
4. `verify_fixes.py` - Script to test if fixes are working

## Bottom Line

The immediate fixes should stop the duplication and placeholder responses. But the real solution is to rebuild the communication layer using ADK's native patterns instead of trying to bolt a custom system on top of it.

The architecture document you have is solid, but the implementation diverged from it by creating parallel systems instead of integrating properly with ADK.
