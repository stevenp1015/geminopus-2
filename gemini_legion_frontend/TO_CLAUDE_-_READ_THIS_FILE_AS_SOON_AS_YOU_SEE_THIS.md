TO_CLAUDE_-_READ_THIS_FILE_AS_SOON_AS_YOU_SEE_THIS.md

i can't send u a message in our chat becuase if i interrupt ur workflow in our chat interface, it will fuck everything up lol

so i'm sending u this message in a file

aren't i so funny ???
anyways the message i totally fucking forgot to tell you before was that i want u to design the frontend UX entirely on your own
specifically in the sense that like you should lit make all of the design decisions and every single thing based on LITERALLY whatever you'd like
see it as a sort of creative process where u get to make all the design decisions
a creative expression of YOU, if you will

i'll specify one thing tho, try to avoid neuemorphism or wahtever those design trends are right that all of the AI's are using when designing ui's right now lol

it should fuckin reflect YOU and literally just be whatever you could ever want it to be just to express yourself, whatever that even fucking means lol
