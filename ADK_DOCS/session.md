# Session: Tracking Individual Conversations

Following our Introduction, let's dive into the `Session`. Think back to the
idea of a "conversation thread." Just like you wouldn't start every text message
from scratch, agents need context regarding the ongoing interaction.
**`Session`** is the ADK object designed specifically to track and manage these
individual conversation threads.

## The `Session` Object

When a user starts interacting with your agent, the `SessionService` creates a
`Session` object (`google.adk.sessions.Session`). This object acts as the
container holding everything related to that *one specific chat thread*. Here
are its key properties:

*   **Identification (`id`, `appName`, `userId`):** Unique labels for the
    conversation.
    * `id`: A unique identifier for *this specific* conversation thread, essential for retrieving it later. A SessionService object can handle multiple `Session`(s). This field identifies which particular session object are we referring to. For example, "test_id_modification".
    * `app_name`: Identifies which agent application this conversation belongs to. For example, "id_modifier_workflow". 
    *   `userId`: Links the conversation to a particular user.
*   **History (`events`):** A chronological sequence of all interactions
    (`Event` objects â€“ user messages, agent responses, tool actions) that have
    occurred within this specific thread.
*   **Session State (`state`):** A place to store temporary data relevant *only*
    to this specific, ongoing conversation. This acts as a scratchpad for the
    agent during the interaction. We will cover how to use and manage `state` in
    detail in the next section.
*   **Activity Tracking (`lastUpdateTime`):** A timestamp indicating the last
    time an event occurred in this conversation thread.

### Example: Examining Session Properties


=== "Python"

       ```py
        from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService, Session
    
        # Create a simple session to examine its properties
        temp_service = InMemorySessionService()
        example_session = await temp_service.create_session(
            app_name="my_app",
            user_id="example_user",
            state={"initial_key": "initial_value"} # State can be initialized
        )

        print(f"--- Examining Session Properties ---")
        print(f"ID (`id`):                {example_session.id}")
        print(f"Application Name (`app_name`): {example_session.app_name}")
        print(f"User ID (`user_id`):         {example_session.user_id}")
        print(f"State (`state`):           {example_session.state}") # Note: Only shows initial state here
        print(f"Events (`events`):         {example_session.events}") # Initially empty
        print(f"Last Update (`last_update_time`): {example_session.last_update_time:.2f}")
        print(f"---------------------------------")

        # Clean up (optional for this example)
        temp_service = await temp_service.delete_session(app_name=example_session.app_name,
                                    user_id=example_session.user_id, session_id=example_session.id)
        print("The final status of temp_service - ", temp_service)
       ```

=== "Java"

       ```java
        import com.google.adk.sessions.InMemorySessionService;
        import com.google.adk.sessions.Session;
        import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;
        import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
    
        String sessionId = "123";
        String appName = "example-app"; // Example app name
        String userId = "example-user"; // Example user id
        ConcurrentMap<String, Object> initialState = new ConcurrentHashMap<>(Map.of("newKey", "newValue"));
        InMemorySessionService exampleSessionService = new InMemorySessionService();
    
        // Create Session
        Session exampleSession = exampleSessionService.createSession(
            appName, userId, initialState, Optional.of(sessionId)).blockingGet();
        System.out.println("Session created successfully.");
    
        System.out.println("--- Examining Session Properties ---");
        System.out.printf("ID (`id`): %s%n", exampleSession.id());
        System.out.printf("Application Name (`appName`): %s%n", exampleSession.appName());
        System.out.printf("User ID (`userId`): %s%n", exampleSession.userId());
        System.out.printf("State (`state`): %s%n", exampleSession.state());
        System.out.println("------------------------------------");
    
    
        // Clean up (optional for this example)
        var unused = exampleSessionService.deleteSession(appName, userId, sessionId);
       ```

*(**Note:** The state shown above is only the initial state. State updates
happen via events, as discussed in the State section.)*

## Managing Sessions with a `SessionService`

As seen above, you don't typically create or manage `Session` objects directly.
Instead, you use a **`SessionService`**. This service acts as the central
manager responsible for the entire lifecycle of your conversation sessions.

Its core responsibilities include:

*   **Starting New Conversations:** Creating fresh `Session` objects when a user
    begins an interaction.
*   **Resuming Existing Conversations:** Retrieving a specific `Session` (using
    its ID) so the agent can continue where it left off.
*   **Saving Progress:** Appending new interactions (`Event` objects) to a
    session's history. This is also the mechanism through which session `state`
    gets updated (more in the `State` section).
*   **Listing Conversations:** Finding the active session threads for a
    particular user and application.
*   **Cleaning Up:** Deleting `Session` objects and their associated data when
    conversations are finished or no longer needed.

## `SessionService` Implementations

ADK provides different `SessionService` implementations, allowing you to choose
the storage backend that best suits your needs:

1.  **`InMemorySessionService`**

    *   **How it works:** Stores all session data directly in the application's
        memory.
    *   **Persistence:** None. **All conversation data is lost if the
        application restarts.**
    *   **Requires:** Nothing extra.
    *   **Best for:** Quick development, local testing, examples, and scenarios
        where long-term persistence isn't required.

    === "Python"
    
           ```py
            from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
            session_service = InMemorySessionService()
           ```
    === "Java"
    
           ```java
            import com.google.adk.sessions.InMemorySessionService;
            InMemorySessionService exampleSessionService = new InMemorySessionService();
           ```

2.  **`VertexAiSessionService`**

    *   **How it works:** Uses Google Cloud's Vertex AI infrastructure via API
        calls for session management.
    *   **Persistence:** Yes. Data is managed reliably and scalably via
        [Vertex AI Agent Engine](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/agent-engine/).
    *   **Requires:**
        *   A Google Cloud project (`pip install vertexai`)
        *   A Google Cloud storage bucket that can be configured by this
            [step](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/configure-project#storage).
        *   A Reasoning Engine resource name/ID that can setup following this
            [tutorial](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/agent-engine/).
    *   **Best for:** Scalable production applications deployed on Google Cloud,
        especially when integrating with other Vertex AI features.

    === "Python"
    
           ```py
           # Requires: pip install google-adk[vertexai]
           # Plus GCP setup and authentication
           from google.adk.sessions import VertexAiSessionService

           PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
           LOCATION = "us-central1"
           # The app_name used with this service should be the Reasoning Engine ID or name
           REASONING_ENGINE_APP_NAME = "projects/your-gcp-project-id/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/your-engine-id"

           session_service = VertexAiSessionService(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
           # Use REASONING_ENGINE_APP_NAME when calling service methods, e.g.:
           # session_service = await session_service.create_session(app_name=REASONING_ENGINE_APP_NAME, ...)
           ```
       
    === "Java"
    
           ```java
           // Please look at the set of requirements above, consequently export the following in your bashrc file:
           // export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=my_gcp_project
           // export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
           // export GOOGLE_API_KEY=my_api_key

           import com.google.adk.sessions.VertexAiSessionService;
           import java.util.UUID;

           String sessionId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
           String reasoningEngineAppName = "123456789";
           String userId = "u_123"; // Example user id
           ConcurrentMap<String, Object> initialState = new
               ConcurrentHashMap<>(); // No initial state needed for this example

           VertexAiSessionService sessionService = new VertexAiSessionService();
           Session mySession =
               sessionService
                   .createSession(reasoningEngineAppName, userId, initialState, Optional.of(sessionId))
                   .blockingGet();
           ```

3.  **`DatabaseSessionService`**

    ![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

    *   **How it works:** Connects to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL,
        MySQL, SQLite) to store session data persistently in tables.
    *   **Persistence:** Yes. Data survives application restarts.
    *   **Requires:** A configured database.
    *   **Best for:** Applications needing reliable, persistent storage that you
        manage yourself.

    ```py
    from google.adk.sessions import DatabaseSessionService
    # Example using a local SQLite file:
    db_url = "sqlite:///./my_agent_data.db"
    session_service = DatabaseSessionService(db_url=db_url)
    ```

Choosing the right `SessionService` is key to defining how your agent's
conversation history and temporary data are stored and persist.

## The Session Lifecycle

<img src="../../assets/session_lifecycle.png" alt="Session lifecycle">

Hereâ€™s a simplified flow of how `Session` and `SessionService` work together
during a conversation turn:

1.  **Start or Resume:** Your application's `Runner` uses the `SessionService`
    to either `create_session` (for a new chat) or `get_session` (to retrieve an
    existing one).
2.  **Context Provided:** The `Runner` gets the appropriate `Session` object
    from the appropriate service method, providing the agent with access to the
    corresponding Session's `state` and `events`.
3.  **Agent Processing:** The user prompts the agent with a query. The agent
    analyzes the query and potentially the session `state` and `events` history
    to determine the response.
4.  **Response & State Update:** The agent generates a response (and potentially
    flags data to be updated in the `state`). The `Runner` packages this as an
    `Event`.
5.  **Save Interaction:** The `Runner` calls
    `sessionService.append_event(session, event)` with the `session` and the new
    `event` as the arguments. The service adds the `Event` to the history and
    updates the session's `state` in storage based on information within the
    event. The session's `last_update_time` also get updated.
6.  **Ready for Next:** The agent's response goes to the user. The updated
    `Session` is now stored by the `SessionService`, ready for the next turn
    (which restarts the cycle at step 1, usually with the continuation of the
    conversation in the current session).
7.  **End Conversation:** When the conversation is over, your application calls
    `sessionService.delete_session(...)` to clean up the stored session data if
    it is no longer required.

This cycle highlights how the `SessionService` ensures conversational continuity
by managing the history and state associated with each `Session` object.
