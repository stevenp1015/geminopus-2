**Reference Checklist:** `audit_data_flow_types.md`

This document summarizes the findings from the Data Flow & Type Consistency Audit. The audit focused primarily on the "Minion Spawn" flow, with checks on other relevant areas like Persona Updates and Messaging.

## 1. Minion Spawn Data Flow

**Overall Status:** Largely OK.

| Step                                      | From System | From Type/Key         | To System | To Type/Key             | Verified | Notes / Mismatches |
| :---------------------------------------- | :---------- | :-------------------- | :-------- | :---------------------- | :------- | :----------------- |
| 1. FE: User submits spawn form            | FE (Comp)   | Form state            | FE(Store) | `legionStore.spawnMinion(config)` | Y        | `config` allows flexible naming (e.g., `base_personality` or `personality`). |
| 2. FE: API call to spawn                  | FE (Store)  | `config` object       | BE (API)  | `POST /api/v2/minions/spawn` body (`CreateMinionRequest`) | Y        | FE maps its `config` to `CreateMinionRequest` fields (`personality` for base, `expertise` for areas, `tools` for allowed_tools). This mapping is correct. |
| 3. BE: Service handles spawn              | BE (API)    | `CreateMinionRequest`  | BE (DM)   | `MinionServiceV2.spawn_minion` params | Y        | API endpoint maps `request.personality` to `base_personality` and `request.expertise` to `expertise_areas` for the service call. `request.tools` is **NOT** passed to the service. |
| 4. BE: Minion object created              | BE (Service)| Service params        | BE (DM)   | `Minion`, `MinionPersona` objects | Y        | `MinionPersona` uses defaults for `allowed_tools` and `model_name` as these are not direct params to `spawn_minion` service method. |
| 5. BE: Minion saved to repo               | BE (Service)| `Minion` DM           | BE (Repo) | Repo save method        | Y        | Assumed OK (repo interface). |
| 6. BE: Event payload created (`_minion_to_dict`) | BE (Service)| `Minion` DM           | BE (Dict) | Dict for WS event     | Y        | Output includes nested `persona` dict with all relevant fields from `MinionPersona` DM. |
| 7. BE: `MINION_SPAWNED` WS Event emitted  | BE (Bus)    | `{"minion": dict}`    | FE (WS)   | `data.minion`           | Y        | Payload structure `{"minion": {...}}` is correct. |
| 8. FE: WS handler processes event         | FE (WS)     | `data.minion` (any)   | FE(Store) | `legionStore.addMinion` param | Y        | `data.minion` is cast to `MinionType`. Structure from `_minion_to_dict` aligns with FE `MinionType` (including nested `MinionPersona` type). |
| 9. FE: Minion added to store              | FE (Store)  | `MinionType`          | FE(Store) | `state.minions` record  | Y        | Logic in `addMinion` is sound. |
| 10. FE: Component displays new minion     | FE (Store)  | `state.minions`       | FE (Comp) | Props (`MinionCard`)    | Y        | `Object.values()` used, `key` prop is correct. |

**Issue Identified in Minion Spawn Flow:**
*   **`CreateMinionRequest.tools` field not utilized:** The `tools: List[str]` field defined in the `CreateMinionRequest` Pydantic schema (and populated by the frontend `spawnMinion` call) is **not used** when calling `minion_service.spawn_minion` from the API endpoint (`minions_v2.py`).
    *   **Impact:** The `allowed_tools` for a new minion's persona currently always defaults to `["send_channel_message", "listen_to_channel"]` as defined in `MinionServiceV2.spawn_minion`'s `MinionPersona` instantiation, regardless of what might be sent in the API request's `tools` field.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        1.  If the API's `tools` field is intended to customize `allowed_tools`, then `minions_v2.py` endpoint for spawn should pass `request.tools` to `minion_service.spawn_minion`.
        2.  The `MinionServiceV2.spawn_minion` method signature should be updated to accept `allowed_tools: Optional[List[str]] = None`.
        3.  Inside `MinionServiceV2.spawn_minion`, when creating `MinionPersona`, use the passed `allowed_tools` if provided, otherwise use the default.
        4.  If the API `tools` field is *not* intended to be used, it should be removed from `CreateMinionRequest` schema to avoid confusion.

## 2. Persona Update Data Flow

**Overall Status:** OK.
*   The API endpoint uses `request.model_dump(exclude_unset=True)` which correctly passes only the fields present in the request to `MinionServiceV2.update_minion_persona`.
*   The service updates the domain model.
*   The `MINION_STATE_CHANGED` WebSocket event payload is the full minion dictionary (from `_minion_to_dict`), which the frontend `legionStore.updateMinion` handler uses to update the entire minion state. This is consistent.

## 3. Message Send/Receive Data Flow

**Overall Status:** OK (with previous fix).
*   **`sender` vs `sender_id` Mismatch:**
    *   **Identified & Fixed Previously:** The backend `MessageSchema` (used in WebSocket `message_sent` events) has a `sender` field, while the frontend `Message` type expects `sender_id`.
    *   **Resolution:** The `chatStore.handleNewMessage` function now correctly transforms the incoming message data, mapping `data.message.sender` to `message.sender_id` before adding to the store. This fix is crucial and addresses the mismatch.
*   The rest of the message flow (API call structure, service handling, event emission) appears consistent.

## 4. Channel `id` vs `channel_id`

**Overall Status:** OK.
*   The backend API responses for channels use `id` (e.g., `ChannelResponse` schema).
*   The frontend `Channel` type in `types/index.ts` also uses `id`.
*   WebSocket event handlers in `legionStore.ts` that deal with channel events (like `channel_created`) correctly map incoming `channel_id` from raw backend data to the frontend `id` field when constructing the `ChannelType` object for `chatStore`.
*   Where `channel_id` is used directly in `chatStore` methods (e.g., `updateChannel(channelId, ...)`), it's used as a key for the `channels` record, which is consistent with how channels are stored (`state.channels[channel.id]`).

## General Type Consistency

*   Backend Pydantic schemas (`schemas.py`) and frontend TypeScript types (`types/index.ts`) for core entities like `Minion`, `MinionPersona`, `EmotionalState`, `Message`, `Channel`, `Task` are mostly aligned or have identified transformation points.
*   The use of `Optional` in Python and `?` in TypeScript for optional fields seems appropriate.
*   Enum consistency between backend (e.g., `MinionStatusEnum`) and frontend (e.g., `Minion['status']` literal types) is generally good.

## Conclusion of Data Flow & Type Audit

The data flows for key operations are largely consistent, with the necessary transformations (like `sender` to `sender_id`) either in place or identified. The main actionable finding is the non-utilization of the `tools` field from `CreateMinionRequest` in the minion spawn process. Addressing this will ensure the API behaves as expected regarding tool assignment during minion creation. Other areas appear to have robust data handling and type mapping.
