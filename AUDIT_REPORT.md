# AUDIT REPORT - Project Legion

## Initial Assessment

This report outlines the initial findings from analyzing the Gemini Legion codebase against the `IDEAL_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` and other provided context documents.

**Overall State:** The project possesses a conceptually strong and detailed ideal architecture. However, the current implementation state, as detailed in handoff documents, reveals significant deviations and critical bugs, primarily centered around the correct usage and integration of the Google ADK (Agent Development Kit), specifically concerning agent invocation and session management.

**Key Documents Consulted:**
*   `IDEAL_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` (Primary Reference)
*   `Project_Context_Crucible.md` (ADK Usage Bible)
*   `CRITICAL_HANDOFF_V7/MASTER_HANDOFF_v7.md`
*   `CRITICAL_HANDOFF_V6/MASTER_HANDOFF_v6.md`
*   `DEAR_FUTURE_CLAUDE_V5.md`
*   `gemini_legion_backend/core/application/services/minion_service_v2.py`
*   `gemini_legion_backend/core/dependencies_v2.py`
*   `Relevant_ADK_docs_1/` & `Relevant_ADK_docs_2/`

## Core Issues Identified (Preliminary)

1.  **ADK Runner Invocation:**
    *   **Conflict:** Handoff documents report that `Runner.predict()` method is missing or non-functional, while the `Project_Context_Crucible.md` (the authoritative ADK guide for this project) explicitly documents and provides examples for `Runner.predict()`.
    *   **Current Implementation:** `minion_service_v2.py` uses `Runner.run_async()`.
    *   **Reported Problem:** `Runner.run_async()` calls are failing with "Session not found" errors, even though the code attempts to explicitly create sessions using `InMemorySessionService.create_session()` beforehand.
    *   **Impact:** This is the primary blocker preventing minions from generating responses via the ADK and, therefore, the LLM.

2.  **ADK Session Management:**
    *   The interaction between `InMemorySessionService.create_session()` and the `Runner` (whether using `run_async` or `predict`) is not functioning as expected, leading to "Session not found" errors.
    *   Clarity on `InMemorySessionService` behavior, especially its interaction with the `Runner` regarding session creation and lookup, is paramount. The ADK documentation (`Relevant_ADK_docs_2/docs/sessions/session.md`) confirms `create_session` is the correct method.

3.  **Domain Model Implementation vs. Ideal Architecture:**
    *   While some domain models (`MoodVector`, basic `EmotionalState`) exist, they are simplified versions of what's specified in `IDEAL_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md`.
    *   Key concepts like detailed `OpinionScore`, `RelationshipGraph`, `ResponseTendency`, `ConversationStyle`, multi-layered `MinionMemorySystem`, and the full `EmotionalState` structure are largely unimplemented.

4.  **Emotional Engine and Memory System Integration:**
    *   These core components, central to the "Company of Besties" vision, are not yet integrated into the `ADKMinionAgent`'s lifecycle (e.g., via ADK callbacks or `Session.state` manipulation as prescribed by the Crucible).

5.  **ADK Version Discrepancy/Understanding:**
    *   The reported issues with `Runner.predict()` suggest a potential misunderstanding of the ADK v1.1.1 API or, less likely, a discrepancy between the installed version and the documentation (`Project_Context_Crucible.md`). This must be resolved first.

## Component-Specific Audit (Ongoing)

### `gemini_legion_backend/core/application/services/minion_service_v2.py`
*   **Intended Purpose:** Manages the lifecycle and interactions of Minions, including spawning, despawning, and processing messages to generate responses using ADK agents.
*   **Current State:**
    *   Correctly uses an event bus for inter-service communication.
    *   Attempts to use `ADKMinionAgent` and `Runner`.
    *   Runner instantiation per agent seems correct, using a shared `InMemorySessionService`.
    *   The `_handle_channel_message` method attempts to create a session using `self.session_service.create_session()` and then calls `runner.run_async()`.
*   **Identified Issues:**
    *   Primary site of the "Session not found" error when `run_async()` is called.
    *   The fallback to `Runner.predict()` was attempted by previous Claudes and reportedly failed due to the method not being found. This needs re-verification against `Project_Context_Crucible.md`.
    *   Emotional and memory cues are prepared for `Session.state` but their effectiveness is hampered by the Runner invocation issues.

### `gemini_legion_backend/core/dependencies_v2.py`
*   **Intended Purpose:** Centralized setup and provision of application dependencies, including repositories and services.
*   **Current State:**
    *   Correctly initializes `InMemorySessionService` once and passes it to `MinionServiceV2`.
    *   Does not instantiate a global `Runner` but rather `MinionServiceV2` creates per-agent runners. This is acceptable.
*   **Identified Issues:** None specific to this file, contingent on `InMemorySessionService` and `Runner` behaving as documented.

### `gemini_legion_backend/core/infrastructure/adk/agents/minion_agent_v2.py`
*   **Intended Purpose:** Implements the ADK-compliant agent representing a Minion, extending `LlmAgent`.
*   **Current State:**
    *   Correctly subclasses `LlmAgent`.
    *   Stores `Minion` domain object as a private attribute (`_minion`) and other necessary services like `_event_bus`, `_emotional_engine`, `_memory_system`. This aligns with Crucible recommendations (using private attributes for Pydantic compatibility if direct assignment after `super().__init__` causes issues).
    *   Dynamically builds its instruction in `_build_base_instruction()` using persona and emotional state (though the latter part is more of a placeholder if the emotional engine isn't fully updating `Session.state` yet).
    *   Implements `start()` and `stop()` methods (basic logging for now).
    *   Implements `process_event()` to listen to event bus events (e.g., `MINION_CONFIG_UPDATED`).
*   **Identified Issues:**
    *   The integration points for deeply connecting the emotional engine and memory system (e.g., using ADK callbacks like `before_model_callback` or `after_model_callback` to inject context into prompts or process outputs) are not fully fleshed out. This is secondary to the Runner invocation problem.
