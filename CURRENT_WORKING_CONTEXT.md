Current Module/Feature Focus: "Frontend Integration - Testing UI Components with Live Backend"

General Goal for Current Session/Module: "Complete the frontend-backend integration by ensuring all UI components can successfully communicate with the backend API and receive real-time updates via WebSocket."

Specific Next Action Planned: "Start the backend server and frontend dev server to test the integration. Verify that: 1) Minions can be spawned from the UI, 2) Messages flow in real-time, 3) Task updates are reflected immediately, 4) Emotional states update properly. Fix any integration issues that arise during testing."

Key Architectural Decisions/Blockers Encountered (if any): "Frontend stores are now fully integrated with the backend API! All three stores (legionStore, chatStore, taskStore) are calling the correct endpoints. WebSocket event handling is complete with proper event forwarding between stores. The system is ready for integration testing. Next step is to run both servers and verify everything works together!   .  .   ."
